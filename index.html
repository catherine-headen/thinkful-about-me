        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>No three sentences can hold me! The last time they tried I shot each one in the leg.</p>

        <p>What's important to me are the following (not listed in any particular order): Asymmetry (in both life and art). Excitement. Surprises. Stillness. Winks.</p>

        <h1>My Favorite Place</h1>

        <p>Venice. It is unbelievably amazing and beautiful. Open canals everywhere and you can fall into the water at any moment. I love that only Venetians can be buried in Venice. And once you are buried, your body can only stay there for a certain amount of time before it has to be moved to the mainland.</p>

        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>

        <p>Pretty much everything I'm doing now except getting paid 10x more for it.</p>

        <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>

        <p>Mostly my husband's band playing originals and cover songs. He recently played an heartbreaking version of In Your Eyes for a bride walking down the aisle.</p>
